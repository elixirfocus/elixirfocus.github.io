      <description>The following is a collection of resources and suggestions for people looking to acquire full time or project specific employment writing Elixir. I personally lean more on consulting but the topic of Elixir employment comes up enough that I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share what I&amp;rsquo;m aware of.
Elixir Job Listings First we have the aptly named elixirjobs.net, which provides an active catalog of known job listings.
I also highly recommend the #jobs, #jobs_chat, and #looking_for_contract rooms of the official Elixir Slack</description>

      <description>One of our primary day-to-day responsibilities as programmers is to communicate. We need to express our ideas, explain our work and document our code. Having a strong vocabulary and explicit intentions behind the words you (and your team) choose can greatly help avoid confusion.

      <description>While browsing the ElixirForum the other day I spotted this question from Dominic which resonated deeply with my own experiences learning Elixir. Dominic asks:
 I&amp;rsquo;m constantly being blocked by maps&#39; different construct %{:atom =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;value&amp;quot;} vs. %{&amp;quot;string&amp;quot; =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;value&amp;quot;} vs %{name: &amp;quot;value&amp;quot;}.
