    </header><p>A few months ago I kicked off the next sample project for this website, a team retrospective board built using Phoenix LiveView called <a href="https://github.com/elixirfocus/retro_taxi/">RetroTaxi</a>. More info about the project is available in the <a href="/posts/retro-taxi-project-kickoff/">project kickoff</a> and today I&rsquo;ll share how it has been coming along.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>From the scope of the <a href="https://github.com/elixirfocus/retro_taxi/blob/main/docs/c1/feature_post_and_vote.md">original pitch document</a> you&rsquo;d like to think I would have gotten further along by now but a mix of client responsibilities and then a <a href="https://mikezornek.com/posts/2021/7/vacation/">extended personal vacation</a> kept me distracted. Over the past week however I have gotten back into the project and can show some basic things working.</p>
<p>First, a user can visit the home page and create a new board. This create board form also asks for their name, since they will be displayed as the meeting&rsquo;s facilitator to future collaborators.</p>

</figure>
<p>With the board created you are redirected to the board page, which shows the custom title and displays the facilitator in the to-be-fleshed-out &ldquo;who&rsquo;s here&rdquo; section.</p>
<p>Each board has four columns and each column has content cards. You can add cards to columns and you can edit cards. There is no active pub/sub between multiple people viewing the board and seeing the cards change (yet), that is still forthcoming.</p>

<p>The site is styled with Tailwind CSS through I wouldn&rsquo;t say it represents a final visual language by any means. I hope to finish the project with a vanilla Phoenix LiveView setup and then move on to experiment with <a href="https://surface-ui.org/">Surface</a> for a fuller UI component experience.</p>
<p>Since I wrote the <a href="https://github.com/elixirfocus/retro_taxi/blob/main/docs/c1/feature_post_and_vote.md">original cycle one pitch</a> I feel like my understanding of what I want to build and how it will all work has been very fluid. I have pretty much dropped the concept of cycles and have just started tagging issues with a <code>MVP1</code> label since this project&rsquo;s progress has clearly not been constrained by time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to be more deliberate with <a href="https://github.com/elixirfocus/retro_taxi/issues">issues</a> and pull requests moving forward so if you want a peek or contribute, check them out.</p>
<p>Hopefully I&rsquo;ll also be able to start extracting some more code-specific blog posts from the project soon. If you have any specific questions, let me know <a href="mailto:zorn@elixirfocus.com">zorn@elixirfocus.com</a>.</p>
