      <description>One of our primary day-to-day responsibilities as programmers is to communicate. We need to express our ideas, explain our work and document our code. Having a strong vocabulary and explicit intentions behind the words you (and your team) choose can greatly help avoid confusion.

      <description>While browsing the ElixirForum the other day I spotted this question from Dominic which resonated deeply with my own experiences learning Elixir. Dominic asks:
